##### Ready to change the world

Howdy! I am Ezekiel Quintanilla

My story begins in Sinton, TX, a small town of 5,000 residents just a short drive from the warm shores of the Gulf of Mexico. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin 2014 with a BA in History but have since found my calling in software development.

I'm someone who can appreciate a good book on Spanish history as well as spend a night reading documentation on a java tool or python library. I love learning, adapting, overcoming obstacles, and am never one to back down from a challenge. Connect with me at the links below!
