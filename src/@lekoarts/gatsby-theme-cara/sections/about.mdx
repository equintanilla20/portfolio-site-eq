##### Ready to change the world

Howdy! I am Ezekiel Quintanilla

I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin 2014 with a BA in History but have since found my calling in software development. In 2016 I began working as a Software QA Engineer eventually making my way into my first Application Developer role in 2022.

In that time I also re-enrolled in college courses at Austin Community College and Texas State University to study computer science.

I love learning, adapting, overcoming obstacles, and am never one to back down from a challenge. Connect with me at the links below!
