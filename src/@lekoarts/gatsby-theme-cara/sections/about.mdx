Howdy!

I am Ezekiel Quintanilla

My story begins in Sinton, TX, a small town of 5,000 residents just a short drive from the warm shores of the Gulf of Mexico. My journey to becoming a software engineer is nothing if not unconventional. After cruising through high school I attended the University of Texas at Austin leaving my family for the big city ('big' by Sinton standards).

A small fish in a big pond, I had to adapt to survive not just school, but living on my own. I graduated in 2014 with a BA in History and set out on my first job as a Bilingual (English/Spanish) contact center analyst with Interactions LLC.

Every opportunity for advancement was one I would immediately take eventually moving into the Software QA department as their newest engineer in late 2016. There I was, with no prior technical experience outside of my own nerdy fascination with technology, eager to learn and prove my worth.

My passion for software development began earnestly in my new role but I eventually sought out online MOOCs and bootcamps to hone this new skill. First learning javascript and several of its popular libraries I came to the realization that this was it...this was what I wanted to do...this is what I was looking for. I wanted to create things. I wanted the freedom solve problems and have greater potential to make the world a better place. To that end I re-enrolled in college with the goal of earning a Masters degree to prove to myself that I am more than my liberal arts degree might suggest.

I am someone who can appreciate a good book on the influence of Arabic culture in medieval Spain as well as spend a night reading documentation on a new exciting java tool or python library. I am paving my path to success with my past struggles. I proudly understand who am I and who I want to be. I'm ready to do my part and change the world.
