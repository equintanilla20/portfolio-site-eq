##### Ready to change the world

Howdy! I am Ezekiel Quintanilla

I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin 2014 with a BA in History but have since found my calling in software development. Originally self-taught, I earned my first role in technology as a Software QA engineer in 2016. While working full time, I've earned an associates degree in Computer Science in 2020 and am now enrolled at Georgia Tech pursuing a masters degree.

I currently specialize in full stack enterprise conversational AI applications in the contact center industry but am ready and willing to tackle any opportunity.

I love learning, adapting, overcoming obstacles, and am never one to back down from a challenge. Connect with me at the links below!
